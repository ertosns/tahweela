Description: # the code is divided into the server ./core/server/server.py, and database ./core/queries/database.py, and tests ./core/tests/
        
        
        # to understand content you can refer to the documentation as well available under ./out/
        to generate the documentation run 'make docgen' in this directory
        
        # to run the server execute sudo -u tahweela python3 ./core/server/server.py.
        
        # to run the tests execute 'sudo -u tahweela python3 ./core/tests/database.py for testing the database', (15 test cases) and 'sudo -u tahweela python3 ./core/tests/core_test.py' for testing the core stories (5 test cases)
        
        # the code add more features no mentioned in the criteria, specially at the database level, for the rest some of them aren't complete, others are halfway.
        
        # preparing the environment, installing necessary libraries, and running the server is by executing 'sudo python3 install.sh'
        
        # note that none of the first scripts would run before running the last install command.
        
        # there is a client, and market implemented, but both are commented, out,  but aren't included in the test, and duplicated.
